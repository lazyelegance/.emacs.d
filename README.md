## Emacs Config

Apparently I wasn't cured after my last experience with Emacs (sorry Atom). This
is my latest attempt to get a serviceable configuration together.

This will be super messy for a long time. I'm trying new things in a very lazy
way, so please do not replicate anything I do here, it's almost certainly wrong.

### Things to consider:
* Get better with evil mode
  * This means using evil-surround / evil-visualstar
* Get better with magit
* Remove custom.el
* Get better with vim-like commands in general.
